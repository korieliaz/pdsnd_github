### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project utilizes pandas and numpy to analyze US Bikeshare Data in three cities: Washington, New York City, and Chicago.

In this application, the user is prompted for which city they'd like to receive more data on. They can choose the month and day of the week, or all for either option. The user is then presented with multiple statistics about bikeshare use in the city they have chosen, including:
- Time of Travel
- Start/End Station 
- Trip Duration
- User Information (type of customer, gender, birth year)

This program also makes use of custom exception classes to ensure that user input is regulated to match acceptable inputs.

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
